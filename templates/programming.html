    <h1 class="h2"> Machine Learning </h1></div>

    <p>Most of us are unaware that we already interact with Machine Learning everyday. Every time we Google something, listen to a song, or even take a photo, Machine Leaning is part of the engine behind all these things and is in the forefront of technological and medical advancements such as self-driving cars and creating new drugs. </p>

    <p>The reason that Machine Learning techniques have seen a wide range of use is because such techniques allow the machine to learn and find underlying patterns within complex data that would otherwise be a struggle to discover. Essentially, with machine learning we can now instead of having humans creating rules with data in order to create answers to a problem as in traditional software engineering, machine learning can use the data and answers to discover the rules behind the problem. </p>

    <p>To learn the rules governing a phenomenon, machines have to go through a learning process where they try different rules based on how well they perform. </p>

    <p>When performing Machine Learning, the data is usually in the form of a matrix. The rows of the matrix represent a <strong>sample</strong>. A sample is just an example of the data we are working with, for example a sample may represent a person, hence in this case row 0 of the matrix will represent data for person 0, row 1 of the matrix will represent the data for person 1, and so on. The columns on the other hand represent the <strong>features</strong> of the samples. Continuing with the person analogy: column 0 may represent the color of a person's eyes, column 1 may represent height and so on. </p>

    <p>There are multiple forms of Machine Learning. From unsupervised Machine Learning where you give the computer only input data and the computer may decide to cluster the samples into separate groups where each group contains samples that are similar to one another based on their features. For example: if we have a dataset where the samples are the faces of people and the features are the pixels of the people. The computer may be able to cluster the faces into separate groups, where the first group may be all the green-eyed people, the second group are all the brown eyed people and etc. In this way, the computer may learn to distinguish faces. In this course, however, we'll be focusing on supervised learning which is normally associated with making future predictions. </p>

    <p><strong>In supervised learning </strong>, we have the <strong>input</strong> matrix that contains the samples and the features and we have an <strong>output</strong> vector which is the value we wish the machine to predict based on the input matrix (<strong>Note:</strong> entry 'i' of the output vector corresponds to sample 'i' of the input matrix). For example, our input matrix can be where the samples are people and features are their characteristics, the output vector can then be of where they live, how much income they have, etc. In order to learn, the computer, using mathematical models, learns the relationships between the sample's features and the output. Once it learns this relationship well, we can use other inputs the computer has never seen in order to make predictions. </p>

    <p>Being able to adapt to new inputs and make predictions is the crucial <strong>generalization</strong> part of machine learning. In training, we want to maximize generalization, so the supervised model defines the real ‘general’ underlying relationship. If the model is over-trained, we cause <strong> over-fitting</strong> to the examples used and the model would be unable to adapt to new, previously unseen inputs. In order to minimize over-training, when learning we often separate the data into a training set and testing set. We use the training set to find the underlying relationship and then test the relationship we've found on the testing set to see if our predictions are acceptable. </p>

    <p>One type of supervised learning technique is known as linear regression, used to predict continuous outcomes such as predicting the future prices of houses, based on their size and so on. Below, we explore how it works.</p>

      <div class="d-flex justify-content-between flex-wrap flex-md-nowrap align-items-center pt-3 pb-2 mb-3 border-bottom">

    <style> 
      .center {

    <h1 class="h2">Linear Regression</h1> 
    </div>

    <p>Before knowing what is linear regression, let us get ourselves accustomed to regression. Regression is a method of modelling a target value based on independent predictors. This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out cause and effect relationship between variables.</p>

     <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='lin_reg_example.png')}}" alt="Gradient Descent Image" class="center">

     <p>Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. The red line in the above graph is referred to as the best fit straight line. Based on the given data points, we try to plot a line that models the points the best. The line can be modelled based on the linear equation shown below.</p>

     <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='lin_eqn.png')}}" alt="Gradient Descent Image" style="width:50%;height:auto;" class="center"> 

     <p>The motive of the linear regression algorithm is to find the best values for a_0 and a_1.</p>

     <p>Before learning the linear regression algorithm, we have to first look at two important concepts. The <strong>cost function </strong> and <strong>gradient descent</strong> </p>

     <div class="d-flex justify-content-between flex-wrap flex-md-nowrap align-items-center pt-3 pb-2 mb-3 border-bottom">
    <h1 class="h2"> Cost Function </h1></div>

    <p>The cost function helps us to figure out the best possible values for a_0 and a_1 which would provide the best fit line for the data points. Since we want the best values for a_0 and a_1, we convert this search problem into a minimization problem where we would like to minimize the error between the predicted value and the actual value.</p>

    <p>There are different types of cost functions, each with its own advantages and disadvantages and uses in certain situations. But what we'll focus on is one of the simplest and most common function is the mean squared error (MSE) function which is the average of the square of the difference between the prediictioin and the actual value.</p>
    
    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='mse.png')}}" alt="Gradient Descent Image" class="center">

    <p>We choose the above function to minimize which is the difference between the predicted values and ground truth measures the error difference.</p>

     <div class="d-flex justify-content-between flex-wrap flex-md-nowrap align-items-center pt-3 pb-2 mb-3 border-bottom">
    <h1 class="h2"> Gradient Descent </h1></div>

    <p>Gradient descent is a method of updating a_0 and a_1 to reduce the cost function(MSE). The idea is that we start with some values for a_0 and a_1 and then we change these values iteratively to reduce the cost. Gradient descent helps us on how to change the values.</p>
 
     <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='grad.png')}}" alt="Gradient Descent Image" class="center">

     <p>To draw an analogy, imagine a pit in the shape of U and you are standing at the topmost point in the pit and your objective is to reach the bottom of the pit. There is a catch, you can only take a discrete number of steps to reach the bottom. If you decide to take one step at a time you would eventually reach the bottom of the pit but this would take a longer time. If you choose to take longer steps each time, you would reach sooner but, there is a chance that you could overshoot the bottom of the pit and not exactly at the bottom. In the gradient descent algorithm, the number of steps you take is the learning rate. This decides on how fast the algorithm converges to the minima.</p>

    <p>Sometimes the cost function can be a non-convex function where you could settle at a local minima but for linear regression, it is always a convex function.</p>

     <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='convex.png')}}" alt="Gradient Descent Image" class="center">

     <p>To update a_0 and a_1, we take gradients from the cost function. To find these gradients, we take partial derivatives with respect to a_0 and a_1. Now, to understand how the partial derivatives are found below you would require some calculus but if you don’t, it is alright. You can take it as it is</p> 

     <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='grad_cost.png')}}" alt="Gradient Descent Image", style="width:50%;height:auto;" class="center">

     <p>The partial derivates are the gradients and they are used to update the values of a_0 and a_1. Alpha is the learning rate which is a hyperparameter that you must specify. A smaller learning rate could get you closer to the minima but takes more time to reach the minima, a larger learning rate converges sooner but there is a chance that you could overshoot the minima.</p>
